## First 10 Customers Plan

**Phase 1: Manual & Free (Customers 1-5)**

1. Join "Parent Dyslexia Support Group" on Facebook
2. Be genuinely helpful (answer questions, share knowledge)
3. When someone posts "help, my child is struggling with phonics":
   - DM them
   - Offer free access in exchange for feedback
4. Do this 10 times, get 5 to actually use it
5. Collect testimonials

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

**Phase 2: Warm Outreach (Customers 6-10)**

1. Post in groups (with permission) about what you built
2. Jakub's story: "I'm dyslexic, I built this to help kids like me"
3. Offer early-access pricing
4. More testimonials

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

**Phase 3: Paid Acquisition (Customer 11+)**

Now you have:
- Real testimonials
- Proven messaging (what made people sign up)
- Landing page with social proof

Ads will convert better.

## Landing Page (tutoria.ac)

**Current state:**
- Clean, focused message
- Harvard credibility stat
- Video thumbnail
- "Join Waitlist" CTA

**Improvements needed:**
- Add "for dyslexic children" more prominently (SEO + clarity)
- Add parent testimonial (when available)
- Clarify timeline ("Get access in X weeks" vs vague waitlist)

---

## Content Strategy

**Goal:** Be found when parents search for dyslexia help.

**Content types:**
1. Educational (how phonics works, what Orton-Gillingham is)
2. Empathy (stories from dyslexic adults, parent experiences)
3. Practical (tips for helping at home)
4. Product (how Tutoria works, case studies)

**AI-scaled workflow:**
- AI generates content ideas from trending topics
- AI drafts posts/articles
- Human (Jakub) reviews for authenticity
- Human adds personal story where relevant
- Schedule and publish

**Frequency:** 2-3 pieces per week

## Jakub's Story as Marketing Asset

Jakub is dyslexic. This is your most authentic marketing.

**How to use:**
- Personal posts on Facebook ("I struggled with reading...")
- Video content (face to camera, real story)
- School visits ("I know what your students feel")
- Testimonials ("Built by someone who understands")

**Not a gimmick** - it's genuine. But be strategic about when and how to share it.

## Partnership Opportunities

### British Dyslexia Association

**Why:** Instant credibility, access to their audience

**Approach:**
1. Research their programs and gaps
2. Reach out with specific value proposition
3. Offer free access for their community to pilot
4. Co-create content or webinars

**Status:** Not started. Lone could help with introduction?

### Dyslexia Charities

Similar approach. They have audiences, you have a tool.

## Messaging That Resonates

**From parent research:**
- "I don't know how to help my child"
- "The school says wait and see"
- "Specialists are too expensive"
- "I want to do something NOW"

**Tutoria message:**
- "Finally, you can help your child yourself"
- "The same method specialists use, at home"
- "No waiting lists, start today"
- "Built by someone who understands" (Jakub)
