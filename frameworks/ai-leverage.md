## The Core Insight

> "People tend to think about super capable models as a single instance, like getting a faster car. But having a million horses... allows you to test a bunch of different ideas."

**Wrong mental model:** AI = faster execution
**Right mental model:** AI = parallel exploration of possibility space

A 5-person team doesn't just move faster. They can explore 10 directions simultaneously and converge on the best one.

## The Numbers (Anthropic Internal)

| Metric | 12 months ago | Now | Change |
|--------|---------------|-----|--------|
| AI usage in work | 28% | 59% | 2.1x |
| Productivity boost | +20% | +50% | 2.5x |
| Tool calls before human input | 10 | 21 | 2.1x |
| Human turns per task | 6.2 | 4.1 | -33% |

**Key:** 27% of work wouldn't have been done otherwise. AI doesn't just speed up existing work - it makes new work possible.

## The Trust Ladder

From the article:
> "In the beginning I would use [Google Maps] only for routes I didn't know... Today I use Google Maps all the time, even for my daily commute."

Trust progresses through stages:
1. **Unfamiliar tasks** - Let AI handle things you don't know
2. **Familiar tasks** - Let AI do first drafts of things you know
3. **Everything** - Default to AI, override when needed

**Power users (14%)** get 100%+ productivity gains. They've climbed higher on the ladder.

**Implication:** Deliberate practice in delegation. Push past comfort zone.

## What to Delegate

From Anthropic engineers:

| Delegate to AI | Keep for humans |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Easily verifiable tasks | High-level design |
| Well-defined/self-contained | "Taste" decisions |
| Low-stakes (throwaway code) | Organizational context |
| Boring/repetitive | Strategic thinking |
| Outside your expertise + low complexity | Novel architecture |

**The heuristic:** "Can I verify this quickly? Is it boring? Is it outside my expertise but not complex?" → Delegate.

## The Paradox of Supervision

> "Having my skills atrophy is primarily gonna be problematic with respect to my ability to safely use AI for the tasks that I care about."

To supervise AI well, you need skills. But using AI can atrophy skills.

**Counter-argument:**
> "The 'getting rusty' framing relies on an assumption that coding will someday go back to the way it was pre-Claude. And I don't think it will."

**Resolution:** Some skills are like assembly language - historically important but less essential going forward. Focus on skills that remain human: taste, direction, relationships.

## Papercut Sprints

8.6% of AI-assisted tasks are "papercut fixes" - small quality-of-life improvements that wouldn't be prioritized manually.

These compound. Consider a weekly sprint where you knock out accumulated friction.

---

## Full-Stack Capability

AI enables capability expansion:
- Backend devs building UIs
- Researchers creating visualizations
- Non-technical staff fixing code issues

**For Tutoria:** Everyone becomes more full-stack. Ash can do frontend. Julie/Jakub can do content at scale. Frederik can explore more architecture options in parallel.

---

## The Social Shift

> "I like working with people and it is sad that I 'need' them less now."

AI becomes first stop for questions. Less mentorship, less collaboration.

**Counter:** Focus human interaction on what AI can't do - relationships, alignment, morale, culture.

## Applying to Tutoria

| Principle | Tutoria Application |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Parallel exploration | Run multiple approaches simultaneously, pick best |
| Trust ladder | Push team to delegate more, track progress |
| Delegate boring | Use AI for content generation, research, first drafts |
| Keep taste | Frederik keeps product direction, Lone keeps parent empathy |
| Papercut sprints | Weekly session to knock out small fixes |
| Full-stack | Everyone can contribute to areas outside their expertise |

## Key Questions When Stuck

1. "Am I thinking of AI as faster car or million horses?"
2. "Where on the trust ladder am I with this task?"
3. "Can I verify this output quickly?"
4. "Is this a taste decision or an execution task?"
5. "What would I explore if I had infinite time?"
