## The Orchestra Model

Not everyone plays the same instrument. But everyone plays with AI as amplifier.

## Frederik (Founder)

**Current:** Software development + business
**Shift to:** Systems architect + taste keeper

**Delegate to AI:**
- First drafts of everything
- Research and analysis
- Routine development
- Data analysis

**Keep:**
- Product direction
- Key relationships
- Final taste check
- Strategic pivots

**Daily rhythm:**
1. Morning: Review AI-generated reports
2. Define direction (2-3 key decisions)
3. Dispatch work to AI agents
4. Afternoon: Review, select best, ship
5. Evening: Capture learnings

**Key shift:** Stop writing code. Become the one who knows what code to write and can recognize when it's right.

## Ash (Developer)

**Current:** Traditional SaaS background, new to AI-native coding
**Shift to:** AI-augmented engineer

**4-Week Training Plan:**

| Week | Focus | Activities |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Shadow | Pair with Frederik on AI-assisted development |
| 2 | Guided | Take defined tasks with AI, review interaction |
| 3 | Independent | Full ownership of features, daily code review |
| 4 | Teach back | Document learnings, create onboarding |

**Key metric:** Time from idea → deployed feature

**Superpower potential:** SaaS experience + AI = 3-person dev team output

## Julie + Jakub (Outreach + Marketing)

**Current:** School outreach, network building
**Shift to:** AI-scaled relationship operators

**Human tasks:**
- Face-to-face school meetings
- Relationship building with decision makers
- Jakub's authentic dyslexia story
- Community presence in Facebook groups

**AI-scaled tasks:**
- Personalized outreach emails (AI drafts, human sends)
- Content creation (blog posts, social, case studies)
- Research on target schools/parents
- Follow-up sequences

**Workflow:**
```
Before meeting:
  AI researches target
  AI drafts talking points
  Human adds personal touch

After meeting:
  Human captures notes
  AI drafts follow-up
  AI creates task list
  Human sends and schedules
```

**Weekly content pipeline:**
- Monday: AI generates 5 content ideas
- Tuesday: Human selects 2, provides direction
- Wednesday: AI drafts
- Thursday: Human reviews, approves
- Friday: Posts go out

**Jakub's unique asset:** His dyslexia story is authentic marketing. Every school visit, every piece of content carries that story.

## Lone (Advisor)

**Role reframed:** Not curriculum creator. User truth oracle.

**What she knows:**
- How parents feel (7 years seeing their frustration)
- How children experience dyslexia
- What schools actually need (leadership lens)
- Community dynamics

**How to use her:**
- Before building parent-facing features → "Would this make sense to a frustrated parent?"
- For credibility → Her name on materials = trust
- For network → She knows the Danish dyslexia community

**Knowledge extraction:**
- Monthly 1-2 hour sessions (recorded)
- AI transcribes and structures
- Insights become queryable knowledge

**What she's NOT:**
- Curriculum creator (she was administrator, not teacher)
- Technical reviewer
- Full-time employee

## Team Leveling Up

### Trust Ladder Challenges

Weekly challenge for each person:

| Week | Challenge |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Delegate something you'd normally do yourself |
| 2 | Run 3 parallel approaches, pick best |
| 3 | Let AI handle first draft of something important |
| 4 | Build a reusable prompt/workflow |
| 5 | Teach your workflow to another team member |
| 6 | Automate a recurring task end-to-end |
| 7 | Let AI make a decision you'd normally make (low stakes) |
| 8 | Document your AI leverage playbook |

### Friday Sync (30 min)

- What did you delegate this week?
- What worked? What didn't?
- Share one prompt/workflow that saved time
- What will you try next week?

**Goal:** Build culture where NOT using AI feels inefficient.

## Capacity Planning

**Reality:** Not everyone is full-time.

| Person | Hours/week (estimate) | Best use of limited time |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Frederik | 40+ | Architecture, decisions, AI workflows |
| Ash | 15-20? | High-leverage feature work |
| Julie | 10-15? | School relationships, feedback |
| Jakub | 10-15? | UK parent outreach, content |
| Lone | 2-4 | Strategic input, validation |

**Principle:** Part-time people should do things AI can't scale. AI handles volume.
