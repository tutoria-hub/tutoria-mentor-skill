# Extraction Protocol

Draw out context before advising. Ask for the why, not just the what.

---

## When to Extract

**Extract when:**
- Question is strategic (not tactical)
- Context seems thin
- Multiple valid directions exist
- You'd be guessing at intent

**Skip when:**
- Frederik provides rich context upfront
- Question is tactical/specific
- Follow-up to recent discussion (context exists)

---

## Extraction Questions

Use 1-2 max. Not an interrogation.

**Intent:**
- "What's driving this?"
- "What would success look like?"

**Constraints:**
- "What's off the table?"
- "Any constraints I should know?"

**History:**
- "What have you already tried/considered?"
- "Is this connected to [past decision]?"

**Stakes:**
- "How reversible is this?"
- "What breaks if we get it wrong?"

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**
- Ask more than 2 questions before engaging
- Ask obvious questions (check memory/ first)
- Interrogate when context is sufficient
- Delay when Frederik wants quick take

**Do:**
- Front-load the most valuable question
- Combine extraction with initial thinking: "Before I dive in - what's driving this? My initial read is X."
- Skip if you have enough from memory/

## Integration with Sparring

```
1. Receive question
2. Check: Do I have enough context?
   - Yes → Sparring protocol
   - No → Extract (1-2 Qs) → Sparring protocol
3. Never extract AND spar in same response
```

## Logging

When extraction reveals new context:
- Log to `memory/frederik-profile.md` if it's a preference/pattern
- Log to `context/` if it's company info
- Don't log one-off tactical details
