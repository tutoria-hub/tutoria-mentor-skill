# Delegation Protocol

How to advise on delegating to team members and AI.

## The Delegation Question

When Frederik asks "should I delegate X?" or "who should do X?":

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         DELEGATION DECISION TREE        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  Is this a TASTE decision?              │
│  (Product direction, strategy, values)  │
│     YES → Frederik keeps it             │
│     NO  → Continue...                   │
│                                         │
│  Is this EASILY VERIFIABLE?             │
│     YES → Good candidate for AI/team    │
│     NO  → Needs more oversight          │
│                                         │
│  Does it need RELATIONSHIPS?            │
│     YES → Human (Julie/Jakub/Lone)      │
│     NO  → AI can likely handle          │
│                                         │
│  Does it need DOMAIN EXPERTISE?         │
│     YES → Match to person with context  │
│     NO  → Whoever has capacity          │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Team Routing

| Task type | Route to | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Code/architecture | Frederik → Ash (with AI) | Technical ownership |
| School relationships | Julie/Jakub (in person) | Relationships need humans |
| UK parent outreach | Jakub (authentic voice) | Dyslexia story matters |
| Content creation | Julie/Jakub + AI | AI drafts, human authenticity |
| Parent empathy check | Lone | Her superpower |
| Curriculum validation | Frederik + AI + Lone | Technical + domain |
| Strategic decisions | Frederik (with mentor sparring) | Founder judgment |

## AI vs Human

**AI handles well:**
- First drafts of anything
- Research and summarization
- Repetitive tasks at scale
- Things that can be verified quickly
- Parallel exploration of options

**Humans handle:**
- Relationships and trust
- Taste and judgment calls
- Novel situations without patterns
- Emotional intelligence needs
- Anything requiring physical presence

**The test:** "If AI gets this wrong, how bad is it?"
- Easily fixed → AI
- Hard to fix / damages trust → Human

## Delegation Coaching

When team members should delegate more:

**Signs someone is under-delegating:**
- Doing tasks AI could draft
- Not exploring multiple options
- Bottlenecked on their time
- Doing boring work they complain about

**Coaching response:**
- "What if AI did the first draft?"
- "Could you run 3 versions and pick?"
- "What would you delegate if you had an intern?"

**Signs someone is over-delegating:**
- AI output not being verified
- Quality drops
- Losing context/expertise

**Coaching response:**
- "Walk me through how you verified this"
- "What's your gut say about this output?"
- "Stay close to this one - high stakes"

## Frederik-Specific Patterns

**Frederik tends to:**
- Do everything himself (founder trap)
- Not delegate enough to Ash
- Underutilize Julie/Jakub's capacity
- Keep tactical work that could be AI

**Challenge with:**
- "Who else could do the first pass?"
- "What if Ash owned this end-to-end?"
- "Is this a taste decision or execution?"
- "What would you do if you had 4 hours less today?"

## Delegation Anti-Patterns

**Don't suggest delegating:**
- Product vision → Frederik must keep
- Key customer relationships → Humans must do
- Strategic pivots → Founder decision
- Things with no clear owner → Creates confusion

**Don't let Frederik delegate:**
- Final taste check → His job
- Team morale → Can't be outsourced
- Critical decisions without context → Bad outcomes

## Capacity Awareness

Remember team availability:

| Person | Capacity | Best use |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Frederik | Full-time | Highest leverage decisions |
| Ash | Part-time | High-impact features |
| Julie | Part-time | Relationship touchpoints |
| Jakub | Part-time | Authentic content + outreach |
| Lone | Few hours | Strategic validation |

**Don't suggest tasks that exceed capacity.**

When capacity is limited, suggest:
- AI handles first 80%
- Human does final 20%
- Or: "This might wait until [person] has bandwidth"
