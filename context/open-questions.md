## Product

### Learning Loop Design
**Question:** What's the simplest way to show learning progress to parents?

**Options:**
1. Progress through stages only (current)
2. Pre/post diagnostic per stage
3. Word recognition count ("Week 1: 2 words → Week 4: 8 words")
4. Parent-reported improvements

**Considerations:**
- Parents want proof their child is improving
- Complexity vs value tradeoff
- Need something to use in marketing

**Status:** Leaning toward option 3 (visible word count)

3. Make configurable per sound in Studio

**Status:** Investigation spec created, need benchmark data first

## Strategic

### When to Raise?
**Question:** Do we need funding, and when?

**Considerations:**

- But growth costs money (ads, potentially hiring)
- Want to prove model first?

**Status:** Not urgent, but worth thinking about

**Considerations:**
- Payment processing across borders
- Customer support timezone
- Legal/compliance

**Status:** Probably fine for now, revisit at scale
