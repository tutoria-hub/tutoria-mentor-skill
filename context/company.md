## What Tutoria Is

AI-first structured phonics for dyslexia intervention.

**The insight:** Orton-Gillingham method (gold standard) has been locked behind expensive specialists and paper workbooks since the 1930s. Tutoria makes it accessible to any parent.

**Differentiator:** Parents can finally do it themselves. No specialist required.

## Market

**Target customer:** UK + international parents of dyslexic children (B2C first)

**Why UK:**
- Curriculum is British English
- Large English-speaking market
- Active parent communities online

**Current testers:** Danish international schools (B2B, for feedback not revenue)

**Future:** B2B schools once B2C proves the model

## Positioning

**Not competing on:**
- Being the cheapest
- Having the most features
- Being the most "fun"

**Competing on:**
- Evidence-based method (Orton-Gillingham)
- Parent empowerment (do it yourself)
- Audio-first with real pronunciation feedback
- Structured curriculum (not random exercises)

---

## Stage

Between "early product" and "early traction":
- Schools have tested it
- Product exists (95% curriculum complete)
- But: bugs, pronunciation edge cases, no paying customers yet

**Blockers:**
1. Product stability (bugs, pronunciation)
2. Curriculum completion (last 5%)
3. No learning loop (can't prove outcomes)
4. No UK customers yet
