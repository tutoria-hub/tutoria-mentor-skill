## Where We Are

**Stage:** "Last Mile Before Liftoff"

95% there, but can't scale until solid.

## Blockers (Priority Order)

### 1. Product Stability
- Bugs in WebApp UX
- Pronunciation validation edge cases (consonant clusters, hard phonemes)
- Investigation spec created, not yet executed

### 2. Curriculum Completion
- 1,400 exercises exist (was 1,370)
- Last 5% needs polish
- Some exercises have issues to fix

### 3. No Learning Loop
- Can track progress through stages
- Cannot prove learning outcomes
- Need: pre/post diagnostic or visible progress metrics

### 4. No UK Customers
- Landing page exists (tutoria.ac)
- Waitlist CTA, no paying customers
- Plan: Facebook groups + ads (needs refinement)

## What's Working

- Curriculum depth (1,400 exercises, 118 modules)
- Audio infrastructure (ElevenLabs + Studio workflow)
- Agentic development (Studio skill, pronunciation investigation automated)
- Test feedback (Danish international schools)
- Team alignment (everyone has personal connection to mission)
