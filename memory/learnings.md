## 2024-12-04: First Strategic Session

### From Anthropic Article

**Key insight:** "Million horses, not faster car"
- AI enables parallel exploration, not just faster execution
- Small team can explore 10 directions simultaneously
- Pick the best, discard the rest

**Trust ladder is real:**
- Power users (14%) get 100%+ productivity gains
- They climbed higher by deliberate practice
- Most people stay stuck at level 1

**27% of work is net-new:**
- Not just faster at existing work
- New work that wouldn't have been done
- "Papercuts" that compound

**What to delegate:**
- Boring, repetitive, easily verifiable
- Outside expertise + low complexity
- Low-stakes / throwaway

**What to keep:**
- Taste decisions
- Strategic direction
- Organizational context
- Novel architecture

### Company Structure Insights

**Lone's role reframed:**
- NOT curriculum creator (she was administrator)
- IS user empathy oracle
- Knows how parents feel, how kids experience it
- Use for validation, not creation

**Julie + Jakub positioning:**
- Jakub's dyslexia = authentic marketing asset
- Should specialize: one Denmark validation, one UK growth?
- AI scales their output, humans do relationships

**The four streams:**
1. Product Engine (Frederik + Ash)
2. UK Parent Acquisition (Julie + Jakub)
3. Validation (Julie + Jakub)
4. Learning Loop (Frederik build + Lone interpret)

### Growth Insights

**UK parent channels:**
- Facebook dyslexia groups (confirmed)
- British Dyslexia Association (big opportunity)
- Mumsnet/Netmums SEN sections
- Homeschool communities

**First 10 playbook:**
1. Be helpful in groups
2. DM struggling parents
3. Offer free access for feedback
4. Get testimonials
5. THEN run ads

**Landing page needs:**
- "For dyslexic children" more prominent
- Testimonials (when available)
- Clear timeline on access

## Patterns to Watch

**Things that worked:**
- Breaking down by parallel streams clarified ownership
- Reframing Lone's role unlocked better use of her
- Pronunciation investigation → spec created efficiently

**Things to revisit:**
- Julie + Jakub split (both doing both, or specialize?)
- Learning loop design (stages vs word count vs diagnostic)
- When to start B2B seriously
