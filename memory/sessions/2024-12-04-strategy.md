## Context

Frederik initiated strategic discussion about how to structure Tutoria as a company with AI leverage. Started with Anthropic article on how AI is transforming work, evolved into comprehensive company planning.

## Key Discussions

### 1. Anthropic Article Analysis

Read and analyzed "How AI is Transforming Work at Anthropic" (Dec 2025).

**Core insights captured:**
- "Million horses" mental model for AI
- Trust ladder progression
- 27% net-new work enabled by AI
- What to delegate vs keep
- Papercut sprints concept
- Social dynamics shift

**Personal takeaway:** Small team + AI leverage = asymmetric advantage

### 2. Company Context Gathered

- Stage: "Last mile before liftoff" (95% there)
- Blockers: pronunciation edge cases, bugs, no learning loop, no UK customers
- Team: Frederik (FT), Ash (dev), Julie+Jakub (outreach), Lone (advisor)
- Market: UK parents (B2C first, B2B later)

### 3. Tech Stack Explored

Launched subagents to explore:
- Tutoria Studio (curriculum/audio management)
- Pronunciation validation system

**Found:** Pronunciation uses 75% threshold for all phonemes (issue), consonant clusters not handled specially (issue), investigation spec created.

### 4. Parallel Streams Identified

```
Stream 1: Product Engine (Frederik + Ash)
Stream 2: UK Parent Acquisition (Julie + Jakub)
Stream 3: Validation - Denmark (Julie + Jakub)
Stream 4: Learning Loop (Frederik + Lone)
```

### 5. Lone's Role Reframed

Previous assumption: curriculum validation
Actual: user empathy oracle (7 years seeing parent/child experience)

Better use: validation of parent-facing decisions, credibility, network

### 6. Growth Strategy Developed

- UK parents primary target
- Facebook groups identified as channel
- First 10 playbook: manual outreach → testimonials → ads
- Jakub's dyslexia story = authentic marketing asset

## Open Questions After Session

1. Julie + Jakub: both do both, or specialize?
2. Learning loop: stages vs word count vs diagnostic?
3. When to pursue BDA partnership?
4. Ash training: start when?
