### 2024-12-04: B2C First, B2B Later

**Context:** Deciding go-to-market priority

**Options considered:**
1. Focus on B2B schools (existing relationships in Denmark)
2. Focus on B2C parents (UK market)
3. Both in parallel

**Decision:** B2C parents first

**Rationale:**
- "Parents can finally do it themselves" is the differentiator
- B2B requires longer sales cycles, procurement
- B2C can validate product faster
- Testimonials from parents help B2B later

**Status:** Active strategy

### 2024-12-04: UK as Primary Market

**Context:** Where to focus customer acquisition

**Options considered:**
1. Denmark (local, existing network)
2. UK (large market, English curriculum)
3. Both

**Decision:** UK primary, Denmark for validation

**Rationale:**
- Curriculum is British English
- UK market much larger
- Danish international schools are testers, not primary revenue
- Can expand to US/international after UK established

**Status:** Active strategy

### 2024-12-04: Facebook Groups Before Ads

**Context:** How to get first 10 customers

**Options considered:**
1. Run ads immediately
2. Organic only (slow)
3. Manual outreach in groups → then ads

**Decision:** Manual Facebook group outreach first, ads after testimonials

**Rationale:**
- Ads without testimonials = lower conversion
- Manual outreach teaches us what resonates
- Free feedback from early users
- Build presence before promotion

**Status:** Not yet started

### 2024-12-04: Progress Through Stages as Learning Loop (MVP)

**Context:** How to show learning progress to parents

**Options considered:**
1. Progress through stages only
2. Pre/post diagnostic
3. Word recognition count
4. Parent-reported improvements

**Decision:** Start with progress through stages, evolve to word count

**Rationale:**
- Simplest to implement
- Already have stage structure
- Can add word count visualization later
- Better than nothing while we figure out ideal approach

**Status:** Needs implementation
